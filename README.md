# Pac-Man

Welcome to our Atari Pacman game repository built in C and Assembly with raster graphics! The code is well-structured and follows good programming practices. Although the game is complete, there's still room for improvement by adding new features, power-ups, and more challenging levels. This repository can serve as a useful reference for students interested in game development, programming in C and Assembly, and raster graphics. We had a great time working on this project as a team and we're excited to share it with you. Thank you for checking out our project!
